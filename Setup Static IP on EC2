How to Add a Static IP to an AWS EC2 Instance:
Prerequisites
This article doesn't have many prerequisites, it is a tutorial which will assume you already have an AWS EC2 instance provisioned already, that is ready to be associated with an elastic IP address. In case you do not already have an AWS EC2 instance running, please create one before proceeding.

Step 1: Choosing Elastic IP
From the AWS console, navigate to EC2 by clicking Compute. This should take you straight to your EC2 dashboard. On your dashboard, click on Elastic IPs under Network & Security. Proceed by clicking Allocate.

Step 2: Creating New IP
Click on Allocate Elastic IP address to create a new static IP address.

Step 3: Assigning IP to EC2 Instance
Once the allocation request is successful, assign the static IP to your EC2 instance. On the elastic IP view, select the IP you just allocated and click the Actions dropdown. Select the View details button to reveal the info page on the elastic IP. On the page, click the Associate Elastic IP address button.

Step 4: Associating IP to Instance
Search for your instance ID from the Instance field. Select the instance ID and scroll down to click the Associate button.

Step 5: Checking The Instance View
Your elastic IP address has now been associated with your EC2 instance. Head to your instance view by clicking on your instance ID. The address of your static IP is now displayed on the view.
